# icpc-trd: Team Reference Document

This repository holds the reference document used by Purdue's ICPC team for the 2024-2025 season, Waffle Wizards.

## Build

Build the TRD with `make trd`.

## Credit

The majority of this TRD is credited to [KACTL](https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl) and Zhtluo's [cp-reference](https://github.com/zhtluo/cp-reference). Unattributed content (not ideal, I know) is probably taken from one of these two.
